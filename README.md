# Beth Witten's Personal Page

#### Hi, I'm Beth.

I'm currently a full time student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.

I'm working on building out my personal website and portfolio here: https://brwitten.github.io/

This is a *work in progress* so please be kind, but pull requests are welcomed :)

Feel free to reach out to me at bethrwitten_AT_gmail_DOT_com.
